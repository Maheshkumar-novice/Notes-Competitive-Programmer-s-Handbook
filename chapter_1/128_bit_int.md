The ability of the `g++` (GNU C++) compiler to provide a 128-bit integer type (`__int128_t`), even on 64-bit systems, is an interesting feature of the compiler's implementation. Let's break down how this works:

### 1. **Hardware vs Software Emulation**
While the system architecture (e.g., 64-bit systems) directly determines the size of its general-purpose registers (64-bit in this case), the compiler can go beyond the hardware's native word size by using **software emulation** to support larger data types.

- On a 64-bit system, the CPU natively handles 64-bit integers, but the compiler can emulate arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) on larger integers by breaking the operations into smaller steps, each using 64-bit operations. For example:
  - A 128-bit integer can be represented as two 64-bit integers.
  - Addition or multiplication of 128-bit numbers can be split into multiple operations on 64-bit chunks, with proper handling of carry bits (for addition) or overflow (for multiplication).
  
This means that the compiler does the "heavy lifting" to allow manipulation of types larger than the CPU's native word size.

### 2. **How does the compiler implement this?**

The compiler uses **multiple-precision arithmetic** (similar to how libraries like GMP—GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library—work). When you declare a variable of type `__int128_t`, the compiler manages it as two 64-bit integers internally and generates assembly code to handle operations like:

- **Addition**: Split the 128-bit integer into two 64-bit halves. Add the lower halves, and propagate any carry to the upper halves.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply the lower halves and handle carry bits or overflow. Handle the multiplication of upper halves and add the intermediate results.
- **Division and comparison**: Similar techniques are used to compare or divide larger-than-native types.

This allows `g++` to offer 128-bit types even when the CPU only supports up to 64-bit natively.

### 3. **Compiler-specific Extensions**
The 128-bit integer type (`__int128_t`) is not part of the **C++ language standard**. Instead, it is a **compiler-specific extension** provided by GCC (and Clang, another popular compiler). The C++ standard itself only guarantees types like `int`, `long`, and `long long`, but it allows compilers to introduce additional types as long as they don't break the standard.

This is why you won't see `__int128_t` in all compilers or all environments, especially in some contest systems that may use different compilers or settings.

### 4. **Language Specification and Extensions**
While the C++ standard doesn’t directly require support for types like `__int128_t`, the language and its specifications allow **compiler vendors** to add platform-specific or compiler-specific extensions. These extensions can introduce features like larger data types, but they are usually not portable across all compilers or platforms.

For example:
- In GCC and Clang, `__int128_t` is available as an extension for handling large integers.
- Other compilers (e.g., Microsoft Visual C++) do not natively provide `__int128_t` since it’s not part of the C++ standard.

Since `__int128_t` is not a standard type, relying on it in competitive programming can be risky. Many contest platforms may use different compilers that don't support this type, making your code non-portable.

### 5. **Range of `__int128_t`**
The 128-bit integer (`__int128_t`) provides a massive range:
- Signed range: \( -2^{127} \) to \( 2^{127} - 1 \), approximately \( -10^{38} \) to \( 10^{38} \).
- Unsigned range: \( 0 \) to \( 2^{128} - 1 \), approximately \( 10^{38} \).

This is very useful when you need to handle extremely large numbers, but again, it’s primarily available in specific environments (GCC, Clang), and you should check system support when working in competitive programming.

### Example Usage:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    __int128_t a = 12345678901234567890ULL;
    __int128_t b = 98765432109876543210ULL;
    __int128_t c = a * b;

    cout << (long long)c << "\n";  // Convert and print part of the result
}
```
Note that printing `__int128_t` directly is not supported by `cout`, so you'd need to manually convert or print it in parts (using some helper functions).

### Summary
- The `__int128_t` type in `g++` is possible due to **software emulation** that simulates 128-bit arithmetic on systems that natively support only 64-bit integers.
- This type is a **non-standard** extension provided by specific compilers like GCC and Clang.
- It's useful for working with very large numbers but isn’t available in all compilers or environments, making it less reliable in competitive programming contexts where portability is essential.
