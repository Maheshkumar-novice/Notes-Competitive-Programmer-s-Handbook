In C++, these two lines are often used at the beginning of competitive programming code to improve input/output performance. Let me explain each part:

1. **`ios::sync_with_stdio(0);`**:
   - By default, C++ streams (`cin`, `cout`) are synchronized with the C I/O streams (`scanf`, `printf`). This allows for interleaving between `cin`/`cout` and `scanf`/`printf`.
   - However, this synchronization makes `cin` and `cout` slower. By disabling it (`sync_with_stdio(0)`), you can speed up input and output operations.
   - **Warning**: After doing this, you **should not** use `scanf`/`printf` alongside `cin`/`cout` because their behavior will no longer be synchronized.

2. **`cin.tie(0);`**:
   - By default, `cin` is tied to `cout`, which means that every time `cin` is used, `cout` is flushed (i.e., all pending output is written to the console).
   - Untying `cin` from `cout` (using `cin.tie(0)`) allows for faster input because the flushing of `cout` is delayed until it's necessary.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);  // Disable synchronization with C stdio
    cin.tie(0);               // Untie cin from cout
    
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << a + b << "\n";    // Fast input/output for competitive programming
}
```

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
using namespace std::chrono;

int main() {
    string a;
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout << "Sleeping...." << endl;
    cout << "hi" << "\n";
    cin >> a;
    cout << a;
    this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::seconds(2));
    cout << "hello" << "\n";
}
```

This combination is useful when you need very fast input/output handling, which is common in competitive programming where large amounts of data need to be processed quickly.
